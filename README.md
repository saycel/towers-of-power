# Towers of Power 2018: Development and Infrastructure

In NYC we take our cellphone and wifi signals for granted.  Its always on and we are always connected. This not the case for 2 billion people who lack affordable communication and 700 Million people who have no coverage at all.  New technologies are democratizing communications infrastructure; Software defined radios, lowered hardware pricing and open source solutions have made it possible to install low cost infrastructure that can be controlled by communities instead of multinational corporations.  

In this class you learn how to create your own communications networks. We will cover the software, and hardware used today in community based cellular networks in Mexico and Nicaragua, as well the DIY infrastructure solutions data networks. We will also delve into the business of international development through guest speakers working in the development or telecommunications fields.

2. Do one of the following assignments below (you may work in groups): 
+ Look at Radio spectrum and record something interesting. If you don’t know what it is, try to figure it out, better yet try to demodulate it. 
+ Make a PNK. Install P5. Make a sketch to run on wifi network.

## Week 5
### Business

#### Homework (you may work in groups):  
Work on your final!
Your final will be a pitch to potential investors about a location you want to install a cellular network, a product that uses the GSM spectrum, or telephony service.  Your project should be useable in developing communities and you should have an understanding of the background of the region or people your service or product would target. 

For next week you will present the class with a prototype in order to beta test and allow us to provide constructive criticism.
The prototype can be a simple paper prototype or a complex system. The objective is to have a clear understanding of the product or service. In addition to your prototype prepare your inital pitch.  


## Week 6
### Prototype Workshop
+ Present your prototype.  
+ Present your initial pitch.  


## Week 7
### Final Presentations / Pitch your Project
